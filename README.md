# What's up lovely people! It's Jordan

I'm just a guy who loves music, anime nerd, and movie buff. In my past life, I even helped blow things up in some of your favorite movies and tv shows. Now a days though you can find me writing code so you can do that slightly annoying thing that only you think about a tiny bit faster.

## Current Projects & Learning

Currently I've been working on building out Crate, a web application allowing users to track, rate, and share their music journeys. And yes I totally did get the idea from Letterboxd, but I figured, the great designer, Virgil Abloh's 3% rule made a lot of sense here.

## Other Projects
**[PokéOrigins: Pokédex](https://pokedex-jalq.onrender.com/)** – A web app that fetches and displays Pokémon data using the PokéAPI. Made to help a friend quickly search up Pokémon data while filming a youtube series.

**[Pom-Pom: Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/jwalker-swe/pom-pom)** – A web app designed to enhance focus and productivity through a technique that breaks work into timed intervals with short breaks in between, known as the pomodoro method.

**[Ro-Sham-Bo](https://github.com/jwalker-swe/ro-sham-bo)** – A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built simply because I find myself making many decisions based on a coin toss, "Should we watch this movie or that movie?", "Should we grab this or that to eat?", "This game or that game?"...you get the point.

**[Can I Pet That Dog?](https://github.com/jwalker-swe/pet-that-dog)** - Honestly I don't even know how to describe this one. Perfect for a good laugh though.
