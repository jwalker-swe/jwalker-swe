# Hi, I’m Jordan

a software engineer passionate about building impactful applications. I specialize in full-stack development with React, Node.js, and TypeScript, creating tools that solve real problems and improve user experiences.

Before coding, I worked in visual effects on major films and TV shows, which taught me the value of creativity and attention to detail. Now, I channel that same passion into software development.

## Current Projects & Learning

Currently I've been working on building out **[Crate](https://github.com/jwalker-swe/crate)**, a web application allowing users to track, rate, and share their music journeys. And yes I totally did get the idea from Letterboxd, but I figured, the great designer, Virgil Abloh's 3% rule made a lot of sense here.

## Other Projects
**[UWind Visualizer](https://github.com/jwalker-swe/UWindVisualizer)** - UWindVisualizer or Urban Wind Visualizer is a cli tool that simulates airflow through urban environments using flow fields and recreating airflow patterns like recirculation zones and vortex streets. The data's then rendered in the terminal and visualized with ASCII art. 

**[PokéOrigins: Pokédex](https://pokedex-jalq.onrender.com/)** – A web app that fetches and displays Pokémon data using the PokéAPI. Made to help a friend quickly search up Pokémon data while filming a youtube series.

**[Pom-Pom: Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/jwalker-swe/pom-pom)** – A web app designed to enhance focus and productivity through a technique that breaks work into timed intervals with short breaks in between, known as the pomodoro method.
